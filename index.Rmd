```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
library(distill)

```


We started with [fake news](https://zhusophia.github.io/Fake_Fake_News/), only to end up at phishing. That's just how the world works! 

Taking raw data from [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielfernandon/web-page-phishing-dataset?resource=download), I'm attempting to explore the URLs of phishing websites! 

Taking a look at the raw data: 

DISPLAY RAW DATA 
- grab a first 4 columns + phishing column (move phsidhing column tot he front)


```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(rmarkdown)
paged_table(mtcars)
```


``` 
If you'd rather not
indent your code block by four spaces, you can use 
triple back-ticks on separate lines.
